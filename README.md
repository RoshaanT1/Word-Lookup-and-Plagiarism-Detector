# Word Lookup and Plagiarism Detector

## Overview

The **Word Lookup and Plagiarism Detector** is a C++ project developed using Qt Creator. This application provides two main functionalities: checking for plagiarism and reading text with additional linguistic features. 

### Features

1. **Plagiarism Checker**:
   - Utilizes the Govinston.ai API to check for plagiarism in the provided text.
   - Highlights plagiarized text within the document.
   - Displays the plagiarism rate and word count of the text.
   - **Note**: The Govinston.ai API has a limit of 2500 words per request. Users must create an account on the Govinston.ai website to obtain an API token. This token should be placed in the `plagiarism_checker2.py` file under the `"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"` header.

2. **Read Mode**:
   - Displays the total word count and plagiarism rate of the text.
   - Highlights any plagiarized sections.
   - Provides detailed information for each word that is double-clicked, including:
     - Part of Speech
     - Synonyms
     - Example sentence usage
   - This functionality is powered by the PyDictionary and Dictionary API.
